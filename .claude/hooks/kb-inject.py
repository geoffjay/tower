"""
Claude Code SessionStart hook that injects the knowledge base index.

The tower knowledge base (docs/knowledgebase/, OKF v0.2) carries the project's
decisions, patterns, and conventions. This hook injects docs/knowledgebase/index.md
as context at the start of every session (startup, resume, clear, compact) so an
agent always has the KB map and the consult/update policy in hand — independent of
whether CLAUDE.md gets picked up.

The index is a compact manifest (descriptions, not full docs); the agent reads
individual concept/decision/pattern docs on demand.

Configured under "SessionStart" in .claude/settings.json.
